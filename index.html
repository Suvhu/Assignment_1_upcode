            <li>
              <strong>Follow inspiring accounts:</strong> Seek out content that

            <li>
              <strong>Utilize tools:</strong> Use apps or website blockers to
              limit your access during productive hours.

            <li>
              <strong>Focus on real-world connections:</strong> Nurture offline
              relationships and engage in activities that contribute to your
              goals.
